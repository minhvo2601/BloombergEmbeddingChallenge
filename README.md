# BloombergEmbeddingChallenge
The project is a collaboration between four people going to their first Datathon ever and trying to learn our crafts in data sciene. Our project is working on decoding word embeddings to predict the secret themes and built a classifer for IMBD review classifier. I was responsible for the second part, building a text classifier.

The IMBD classifier was build for sentiment analysis using a dataset containing 5000 rows of movie reviews. To build a classifier to predict whether a custom review is good or bad, a pretrained word embedding, Glove, was applied producing a 68% accuracy. The Glove Vectors for Word Representation was obtained from Stanford NLP GloVe. Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space.
