# BloombergEmbeddingChallenge
The IMBD classifier was build for sentiment analysis was done on the dataset containing 5000 rows of movie reviews. To build a classifier to predict whether a custom review is good or bad, a pretrained word embedding, Glove, was applied producing a 68% accuracy. The Glove Vectors for Word Representation was obtained from Stanford NLP GloVe. Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space.
